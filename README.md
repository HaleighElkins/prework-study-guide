# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

This a prework-study-guide for my bootcamp class. 

I built this project so I can come back to this webpage and use it as a study guide throughout my bootcamp.
I learned how to make basic code, HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. 
I had some problems add an SSH key to my computer and had to do some digging on why is wasn't working. After lots of googling and trying mulitple times I finally got it. 
After the issue with SSH everything else was easier to catch on.

Each secition conatins notes about a certain topic like HTML,CSS,Git, and JavaScript.
